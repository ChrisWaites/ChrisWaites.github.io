      <p>
        Back in the day, something like ford required a healthy mix of skills and acted as a reasonable stratification of wealth
if they were a microcosm representing the greater society, life wouldnt be too bad
      </p>
      <p>
        Now think of facebook it really only takes one person
      </p>
      <p>
        What will we do now that single individuals can automate entire industries
      </p>
      <p>
        Also the strange case of open source where things which would have been companies, people now would do for free because of how low the barrier to entry to productivity is
      </p>
