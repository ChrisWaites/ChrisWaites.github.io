      <h2>
        Deaths of Despair
      </h2>
      <p>
      <p>
        I grew up in a Christian household. A quote which I often heard was the following:
      </p>
      <em>
        Ecclesiastes 1:9. What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
      </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe this is true in one sense, but false in another. Have these things been echoed in other forms in the past? Absolutely. But are these manifestations becoming increasingly more potent? I would argue so.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, you at least had some degree of separation between you and the elite. You can realize this in a few ways, but the way I think the most clearly about is the following. That is, on average, the amount of time these individuals occupy your direct attention, with some implicit weight on subconscious attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s take the median American who makes around $33,706 a year (2018). Now, convince yourself there exists some probability, no matter how small, that such a person exhibits a chance of breaking down upon seeing such a photo after a long and hard day at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many times a day do you think that coin is flipped? There are 350 million americans. Wouldn’t you like to be him? He looks well rested, and if he were to go up to any of his million fans, he would be undoubtedly praised like a living god.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Wealth Inequality
      </h3>
      <p>
        I see Amazon as a useful analog. If you had to distill America{"\'"}s problem, it could be physically manifested as Amazon{"\'"}s structure. Essentially, we have a clear balkanization and class structure. Which is, we have the elite which make decisions and live way more well off than necessary, the engineers, the lower class who are treated unreasonably poorly, and the hyper-elite Jeff Bezos money who is more valuable than is really coprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of writing this, Jeff Bezos is worth approximately 180 billion dollars. To conceptualize this, consider a billionaire. To become a billionaire, you would have had to have had a 4 million dollar salary every year throughout all of American history, which is an absolutely ridiculous salary to have persisted through the civil war, the invention of the cotton gin, throught the civil rights movement, until now. That is poverty in relation to Jeff Bezos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, the problem per say clearly isn{"\'"}t that automation or wealth inequality is new in some sense, this is clearly false. But I would argue that a problem which rapidly exacerbates is indistinguishable from a new problem, and that this principle applies in this context. Of course, every time a new technology comes around it ripples throughout the economy. But the problem now is that the proportions of the population our innovations are having are growing, and the skills they undermine require more and more prior investment. Of course, when the cotton gin came around people surely lost their jobs, but finding other blue collar work was an alternative and learning the upkeep a cotton gin, which required more skill than picking the cotton itself, took an investment on the order of days. Now, we{"\'"}re talking about technology which could potentially undermine manual labor all together, and using methods which require so much more skill, at an unprecedented speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key difference is the following key metric. What proportion of outsourced workers were able to actually contribute or play a part in the technology which outsourced them? With the cotton gin, I would argue that that number was modestly high. That is, the skills you had to be a picker of cotton weren{"\'"}t too far off from maintaining a cotton gin or thinking of new ideas to improve it, it was a mechanical contraption after all. Of course not everyone would exhibit that effort and might simply switch to another industry, but the possibility was there. What proportion of truck drivers outsourced will be able to contribute or play a part in self-driving car technology? Literally zero percent.
      </p>
      <p>
        So lets say you think well get past the self driving truck issue, which id agree we probably will at some cost. Well, again, this is getting worse. Whats the next large scale technological innovation to be had? Almost surey the end of menial white collar work requiring basic linguistic ability and reasoning skills, aka lawyers, accountants and the like. What are we going to tell 40 year old men with kids and a mortgage? Especially when the maintenance of this software requires a team of three engineers? Im sorry but theres no jobs available in this context - midway through your career you might just need to learn how to be a pharmacologist. Its almost in some sense like our efficiency and problem solving ability has become too low of a barrier to entry for our own good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, my argument is not that self driving cars will be the end of civilization. Its that the implications of technological innovation are getting worse. If you think this round of innovation isn{"\'"}t sufficient, wait 100 years. What will we be outsourcing then?

        <summary><i>I want to try and break "Gamer girl water" down for people...</i></summary>
        <i>
        ...coming from someone who had a dark time in my life where I might have been tempted to buy some "gamer girl bath water". It{"\'"}s easy to say "Oh she{"\'"}s just tricking idiots out of their money" but it{"\'"}s a little more complicated than that.<br/>
        <br/>
          <b>When you{"\'"}re approaching your mid to late 20s and still haven{"\'"}t enjoyed a healthy and intimate relationship, it really does start to fuck with you on a scary level.</b> Mental illness, depression, anxiety, and such seem to be a much more prevalent nowadays since it{"\'"}s so easy to get "quick fix" social interaction through the internet. The internet is amazing, but it doesn{"\'"}t make you better at actually being a social human being in real life. You get guys who had quick and easy access to a hundred friends on MSN/AIM/Skype/Discord/Telegram grow increasingly dependant on online interactions for their social needs. I can confirm it gets to the point where you just don{"\'"}t even really want real interactions anymore because pornhub handles your libido, twitch gives you someone to listen to, instant messaging gives you people to talk to, etc. The only thing missing is the sexual physical touch of a woman, and there{"\'"}s a part of you that might think that water that{"\'"}s touched your Twitch crush will satisfy that. It won{"\'"}t of course.<br/>
        <br/>
          <b>The way that the most popular Youtubers, and Twitch Streamers interact with their audience is that of being a friend, family, or lover.</b> How many streamers call their viewers some kind of pet name? Like, the [Streamer name] Family, or the [Streamer name] Army. When your livelihood comes from donations and views, you need to be especially charismatic. The biggest names in online video makers always talk directly to their audience. They look into the camera, they call you their friends and family, they want you to hang out with them at conventions, and they want to hear your comments, they want to read your messages in chat, they offer life advice, they tell you they care about you, they tell you they{"\'"}re thankful for you, they want you to take care of yourself, and often times they{"\'"}ll open up their soul and talk about their lives to you. It{"\'"}s all about charisma and being a good host and it{"\'"}s a great talent to have. For people in the previous point, this can actually be super harmful. You spend enough time in their streams and watching their videos, and you really do start to subconsciously believe that Markiplier, Pewdiepie, and Summit are your friends. Obviously it{"\'"}s not the case, but there was a time in my life where some of my favourite Youtubers were appearing in my dreams and were asking me to hang out, and my brain didn{"\'"}t even question that it was something we just did all the time. I recall a few years ago some kids and their mom showed up to a famous Twitch streamer{"\'"}s address and were confused as to why he felt that was a breach of privacy. They expected to hang out with him, get autographs, play games with him, and all around expect that he{"\'"}d be thrilled to see them. Obviously, this is a huge breach of boundaries, and perfectly sane people just forget that these people don{"\'"}t have a 1:1 friendship with them.<br/>
        <br/>
          <b>When you{"\'"}re 25+ and haven{"\'"}t had meaningful relationships with women, either romantic or otherwise, you start to get weird ideas about what women are, especially if you talk to the wrong groups.</b> When you get to the point where you{"\'"}ve craved intimate love and never had it for over ten years, you start getting weird ideas. Some men lash out at women and get incel-ish. Some men put women on these pedestals as divine trophies to be won. Some men just assume that women will never like them. But the longer you go without ever knowing love, the easier it is to think of women as being a totally different species.<br/>
        <br/>
          <b>When every woman you{"\'"}ve ever known either hates video games or are casual/novice gamers at best, meeting a woman who seems to idolize gaming as much as you do triggers volatile emotions.</b> Sometimes it comes in the form of disdain and skepticism, and end up making a toxic environment for women in gaming. If not that, it comes out as excessive idolization. You{"\'"}re at a point in your life where any woman who would even pay attention to you is a dream, and the thought of a girl who would share your favourite hobby with you may as well be the second coming of Christ. You crush on her hard, you buy all her merch, you send her donations so that she{"\'"}ll start to recognize your name and tell you "thank you" and read your messages. I{"\'"}m not saying that women shouldn{"\'"}t be allowed to be successful gaming streamers, but I do think that taking advantage of clinically depressed and lonely fans like this is awful.<br/>
        <br/>
          <b>This whole, selling bathwater thing to thirsty fans may seem like memes and trolling, but in reality it{"\'"}s just highlighting a very, very sad reality.</b> There{"\'"}s guys out there who would buy this in a futile attempt just to feel closer to the one girl that ever paid them any attention. I was dangerously close to being one of those guys at one point and I know just how scary the spiral goes. People on my path would either end up doing things like buying this bathwater or becoming misogynistic incels.<br/>
        <br/>
          It all sounds so stupid and pathetic, but it{"\'"}s a very true reality for some unfortunate guys suffering from severe depression.
