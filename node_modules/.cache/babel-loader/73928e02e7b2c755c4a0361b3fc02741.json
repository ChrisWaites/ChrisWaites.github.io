I{\"\\'\"}m not saying that women shouldn{\"\\'\"}t be allowed to be successful gaming streamers, but I do think that taking advantage of clinically depressed and lonely fans like this is awful.<br/>\n        <br/>\n          <b>This whole, selling bathwater thing to thirsty fans may seem like memes and trolling, but in reality it{\"\\'\"}s just highlighting a very, very sad reality.</b> There{\"\\'\"}s guys out there who would buy this in a futile attempt just to feel closer to the one girl that ever paid them any attention. I was dangerously close to being one of those guys at one point and I know just how scary the spiral goes. People on my path would either end up doing things like buying this bathwater or becoming misogynistic incels.<br/>\n        <br/>\n          It all sounds so stupid and pathetic, but it{\"\\'\"}s a very true reality for some unfortunate guys suffering from severe depression.\n        </i>\n        </details>\n        <br/>\n      </p>\n\n      <h4>\n          Tinder\n      </h4>\n\n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O-iLk1G_ng?start=3103\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n      <InstagramEmbed url='https://instagr.am/p/Bfw2OPinqme/' maxWidth={320} hideCaption={true} />\n      <InstagramEmbed url='https://instagr.am/p/BoPAPVKAnS0/' maxWidth={320} hideCaption={true} />\n\n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMotykw0SIk?start=1282\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Post;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
