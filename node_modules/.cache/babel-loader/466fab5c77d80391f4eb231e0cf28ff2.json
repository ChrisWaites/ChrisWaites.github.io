A full deep dive into the foundations backing the moments accountant are likely outside the scope of this post, but on a high level it can be thought of as a black box which takes in values which characterize your training loop (sampling probabilities, number of minibatches, delta, etc.) and outputs epsilon. But importantly, their method yields much tighter bounds on the privacy loss achieved than what is reported via the strong composition theorem. If interested in learning more, the algorithm was originally introduced in Abadi et al. and has a corresponding implementation within Tensorflow Privacy.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>\n          Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles or PATE is an alternative method to DPSGD for conducting differentially private learning. The key idea is to, rather than train a single strong model which captures a complex criterion in a differentially private manner, train a set of weaker, non-private models on partitions of the data and then perform a noisy aggregation of their predictions. Overall the method has been shown to be quite effective at the expense of some assumptions about the training procedure. There has even been an application of this technique to GANs via PATE-GAN.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>\n          Differentially Private Federated Learning\n        </h3>\n\n        <h3>\n          Proper Development\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          There are a number of common gotchas involved with the proper development and deployment of differentially private deep learning models.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The biggest is hyperparameter search and model selection. You might think intuitively that, as long as you implement and execute something like DP-SGD, you can sleep soundly at night knowing your model is privacy preserving. Although, typically many models are trained in the process of during the hyperparameter . Although in theory, the hyperparameters you{\"\\'\"}re selecting are technically data-inspired, and hence indirectly leak information. Frankly this detail is swept under the rug in research contexts. But in industry, this absolutely needs to be taken into consideration, or at the very least consciously acknowledged as a risk.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The second is proper evaluation. It does not suffice to simply train a single model and report its accuracy. Recall that\n        </p>\n      </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Post;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
